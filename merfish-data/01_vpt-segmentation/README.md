- `01_vpt-segmentation`: This includes a series of scripts for re-segmenting our MERFISH data using a cellpose segmentation implementation of the Vizgen Post-Processing Tool (VPT). Both of the following subdirectories use the same general VPT workflow, with differences in the number of different segmentation applied to a single experiment.
    - `01_single-algorithm` Use these scripts as a workflow if you are interested in segmenting a single or small number of MERFISH datasets. Simple workflow; follow the scripts in order, `01_`, then `02_`, then, `03_`, then `04_`.
    - `02_hyperparameter-tuning` This section includes scripts I used when segmenting a single dataset many different ways to optimize segmentation results and understand how slight changes affect downstream clustering and computational analysis. Use these scripts as a template if you are testing the results of many different segmentation results. I use some bash scripting to automate this process.
